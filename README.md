<h1> Project Title: </h1>
    Name That Dog!

<h2>Summary: </h2>
    Front page website to test out my skills to follow a customer comp and use Javascript. I used a project from Turing School of Software and Design to try and duplicate. 


<h2>Code Style: </h2>
    Using html / CSS / Javascript

<h2>Screen Shots:</h2>
    Comp is <img src="http://frontend.turing.io/assets/images/dog-party-js-edition.jpg"> 

<h2>Features:</h2>
    If you enter a name into the input field and click the button "Name this dog" the title "A Site About Some Dog" will change the section Some Dog to the name you choose.
<h2>What was easy for me on this project</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The html section was easy for me</li>
    <li>The basics of CSS I was good at but need work with the navigation and flexbox</li>
    <li>Got more proficient with git and git commands as I am now able to initate and pull items from git itself </li>
    <li>Images and colors are easy for me</li>
    <li>Javascript function itself was easy</li> 
</ul>
<h2>What I learned from project and need to improve upon</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I learned I need more experience with CSS code especially with flexbox</li>
        <li>Need to work on a better navigation section, master those areas as that took more time than I felt needed to</li>
        <li>Need to understand more details of connecting Javascript to html and how to designate html item to Javascript function<li>
        <li>The abiltity to adjust my website temporarily in Chrome inspector tools</li>
        <li>Need to learn more about is how to add outside sources or resources to import into website</li>
        <li>I am unknowledgable on how to actual host my code on a server, next step in the process I need to learn</li>
    </ul>
